	 - stories(any story that is using the settings, don't needed to have any connection with the main plot. we accept both short stories and long ones)
	 - main plots(the main plot of the novel, you can create branches named xxx-if to create different stories that based on main plot)

each subfolder will contain difference folders named by the language that is using(e.g simplified chinese folder will contains contents written in the language with the same name)
